# Rules for the schedule creation
# They determine how many simultaneous downloader instances can be run on the same server
# Rules are based on the number of batches required to be downloaded from the server
# Rule is: key - number of batches, value - number of instances; if server has more than key batches, value instances can be run
# Server with 0 batches is considered to be downloaded and are ignored
# Default value is 1
# Order of the rules does not matter
